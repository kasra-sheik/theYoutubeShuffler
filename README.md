# theYoutubeShuffler
Welcome to The Youtube Shuffler! An iPhone application that allows you to randomly shuffle through millions of youtube videos based on different categories! This application utilizes the youtube data API for getting relevant data as well as my own personal API webhook for calling and recieving content in an efficient manner.
